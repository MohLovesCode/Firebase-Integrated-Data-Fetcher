## Demo App: Firebase-Integrated Data Fetcher

### Description:

This demo app showcases a streamlined Android application built with the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture. The app seamlessly integrates Firebase for user authentication, allowing users to both log in and sign up. Additionally, it fetches data from a REST API, offering users the ability to filter information by category. The app then presents the parsed data in a user-friendly display.

### Features:

- User authentication via Firebase
- Seamless login and signup processes
- REST API integration for data fetching
- Category-based data filtering
- Clear presentation of parsed information

### Project Structure:

The project follows the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture, promoting a modular and maintainable codebase. The division into Model (data-related logic), View (UI-related logic), and Presenter (business logic) enhances code organization and readability.

### Usage:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Set up Firebase in your project and configure the necessary credentials.
4. Run the app on an Android emulator or a physical device.

### Dependencies:

- Firebase SDK
- Retrofit for REST API calls
- Gson for JSON parsing
